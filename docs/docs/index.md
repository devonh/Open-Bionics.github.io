# Welcome!

Welcome to the official documentation for projects under development by [Open Bionics](https://www.openbionics.com/)!
Here you will find a variety of useful information. Whether you would like to contribute to the projects, or just want to see how they work, this is the place for you. If you need help building one of the projects or have any additional questions, head to the [Forum](http://openbionics.lefora.com/) where active community members can help you out.

## Site Layout
The documentation is seperated into the following areas:

* `Hardware` - PCB related information.
* `Firmware` - Code that makes the PCBs function.
* `Software` - Additional code that makes the firmware awesome.
* `3D Printing` - CAD files to make something physical.

**Note**: If you are interested in contributing to the documentation, feel free to add your own information and submit a pull request to the Docs repo on our [Github](https://github.com/Open-Bionics/Open-Bionics.github.io)!
