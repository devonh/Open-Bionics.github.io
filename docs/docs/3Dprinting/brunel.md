# Brunel Hand

The Brunel hand is named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the man who revolutionized public transport and modern engineering.
The Brunel hand is not a prosthesis, it is intended as a development kit.

The Brunel Hand is a fully articulated robot hand from Open Bionics.  The hand has 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) and 4 degrees of actuation (DOA). It can be controlled from a PC or MAC over USB connection. The Brunel hand can be programmed using the Arduino programming environment which will be familiar to many developers.

The Brunel hand is perfect for anyone that is doing a project with robotic hands or wants a neat, light, and functional robotic hand for use with a humanoid robot. It's an excellent platform for research into prosthetics, object grasping and many human-robot-interaction applications.
